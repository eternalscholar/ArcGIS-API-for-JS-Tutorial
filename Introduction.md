# ArcGIS API for Javascript: An Introductory Tutorial



## Introduction 

The ArcGIS API for JavaScript is a powerful library that you can use to build applications that leverage the power of the ArcGIS Platform. One of the important feature that distinguishes this API from others is that it is designed to work with data items stored in the ArcGIS online platform. Beautiful visualizations of data, configuring pop-ups, and setting up bookmarks can be authored within the ArcGIS online platform without any coding, and these maps can be easily loaded into the app simply referencing the web mapâ€™s ID. Starting with the API 4.0 (launched in May 2016), one can follow the same pattern to create 3D web apps as well with ease.



## About the tutorial

This tutorial is divided into two parts. Tutorial-I is an introductory tutorial for 2D where three layers, a point layer, a line layer and a polygon layer, will be displayed over a basemap and they will be styled to make them look more attractive. In Tutorial-II, we will deal with 3D where we will extrude data in the third dimension overlaid on a basemap.
